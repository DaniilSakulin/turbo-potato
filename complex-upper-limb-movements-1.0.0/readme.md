The csv data files contain four columns. The data in the first column is the time axis in seconds. The data samples in the other three columns are the x-, y-, and z-coordinates of the reflective marker utilized in each experiment to represent the hand trajectory of movement. The data is reported in meters. Different files contain data pertaining to different subjects for different motor tasks. Different filenames are used for different tasks as follows:

BostonCA --> Writing the word Boston in Capital letters
BostonCU --> Writing the word Boston in cursive letters
HarvardCA --> Writing the word Harvard in Capital letters
HarvardCU --> Writing the word Harvard in cursive letters
Can --> 3D arm movements to reach for and transport a can of soda positioned on a table
Circle --> Drawing circles
Ellipse --> Drawing ellipses
Flower --> Drawing a pure frequency curve with v=4/3
Spiral --> Drawing a pure frequency curve with v=0
SuperMegaCloud --> Drawing a pure frequency curve with v=4/5
Triangle --> Drawing a pure frequency curve with v=3
Planned --> series of 2D planned (i.e. with target) movements of the arm
Unplanned --> series of 2D unplanned (i.e. without target) movements of the arm
Randomness --> 3D random movements
